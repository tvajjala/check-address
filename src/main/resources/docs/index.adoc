This tutorial walks you through the process of consuming a `SOAP-based web service` with Spring.

*It elucidates following items*

* Making parallel calls with http://reactivex.io/[RxJava] (or https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html[WebFlux])
* Sending large SOAP message payloads using AXIOM( AXis Object Model) https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/api/org/springframework/ws/soap/axiom/AxiomSoapMessageFactory.html[AxiomSoapMessageFactory].(which improves performance)
* Marshalling( is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission)


Marshalling (XML Serialization) done with O/X Mappers, different types of mappers out there and choose appropriate one for your need.

. *Castor* XML mapping is an open source XML binding framework.
    It allows you to transform the data contained in a java object model into/from an XML document.
    By default, it does not require any further configuration, though a mapping file can be used to have more control over the behavior of Castor.
    The Spring integration classes reside in the `org.springframework.oxm.castor` package

. *JiBX* The JiBX framework offers a solution similar to that which JDO provides for ORM:
    a binding definition defines the rules for how your Java objects are converted to or from XML.
    After preparing the binding and compiling the classes, a JiBX binding compiler enhances the class files,
    and adds code to handle converting instances of the classes from or to XML.
    Spring integration classes resides in `org.springframework.oxm.jibx`

    refer https://javadigest.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/spring-web-service-example/[this blog]

. *XStream* is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. It does not require any mapping, and generates clean XML.
   The Spring integration classes reside in the `org.springframework.oxm.xstream` package

   NOTE: XStream is an XML serialization library, not a data binding library

We will build a SOAP client that fetches city information based on `zipCode`.

Complete WSDL you can found  http://ws.cdyne.com/psaddress/addresslookup.asmx?wsdl

From the above WSDL we will use following simple service calls

. `ReturnCityState` - This will return City and State Information
. `AlternateCities` - This will return alternate city names


Spring provides a mechanism to invoke soap based services using `WebServiceTemplate`

It has three main components to communicate with soap service, refer
        https://github.com/tvajjala/check-address/blob/master/src/main/java/com/tvajjala/address/config/SoapTemplateConfig.java[SoapTemplateConfig] for full configuration.


. *Message Sender* - which is responsible for sending the XML message across a transport layer(HTTP/JMS/Email)
. *Message Factory* - A factory for creating SOAPMessage objects
. *Marshaller* - is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission


=== Message Sender (HTTP Transport)

There are two implementations of the `WebServiceMessageSender` interface for sending messages via HTTP.

.. The default implementation is the `HttpUrlConnectionMessageSender`, which uses the facilities provided by Java itself.
.. The alternative is the `HttpComponentsMessageSender`, which uses the `Apache HttpComponents HttpClient`.
Use the latter if you need more advanced and easy-to-use functionality (such as authentication, HTTP connection pooling, and so forth).


[source,java]
.messageSenderBean.java
----


    /**
     * Apache httpClient with default behaviour. customize as per need to handle https traffic
     *
     * @return httpClient
     */
    @Bean
    HttpClient httpClient() {
        return HttpClients.custom()
                .setDefaultRequestConfig(RequestConfig.DEFAULT)
                .addInterceptorFirst(httpRequestInterceptor())
                .build();
    }

    /**
     * Remove duplicate header
     */
    public HttpRequestInterceptor httpRequestInterceptor() {
        return (request, context) -> request.removeHeaders(HTTP.CONTENT_LEN);
    }


    /**
     * Transportation: HTTP (Other alternative Transportation like JMS, EMAIL, XMPP)
     * <p>
     * There are two implementations of the {@link org.springframework.ws.transport.WebServiceMessageSender}
     * interface for sending messages via HTTP.
     * 1. The default implementation is the
     * {@link org.springframework.ws.transport.http.HttpUrlConnectionMessageSender}, which uses the facilities

     * pooling, and so forth).
     *
     * @return HttpComponentsMessageSender {@link HttpComponentsMessageSender}
     */
    @Bean
    HttpComponentsMessageSender httpComponentsMessageSender() {
        HttpComponentsMessageSender httpComponentsMessageSender = new HttpComponentsMessageSender();
        httpComponentsMessageSender.setHttpClient(httpClient());
        return httpComponentsMessageSender;
    }

=== Message Factory

Concrete message implementations are created by a `WebServiceMessageFactory`.

This factory can create an empty message, or read a message based on an input stream.

There are two concrete implementations of WebServiceMessageFactory;

.. one is based on SAAJ, the SOAP with Attachments API for Java,

.. the other based on Axis 2's AXIOM, the AXis Object Model.

*AxiomSoapMessageFactory*

The `AxiomSoapMessageFactory` uses the AXis 2 Object Model to create SoapMessage implementations.
AXIOM is based on StAX, the Streaming API for XML. StAX provides a pull-based mechanism for reading XML messages, which can be more efficient for larger messages.

To increase reading performance on the `AxiomSoapMessageFactory`, you can set the `payloadCaching` property to false (default is true).
This will read the contents of the SOAP body directly from the socket stream. When this setting is enabled, the payload can only be read once.
This means that you have to make sure that any pre-processing (logging etc.) of the message does not consume it.



[source,java]
.axiomSoapMessageFactory Bean
----

    /**
     * In addition to a message sender, the WebServiceTemplate requires a Web service message factory. There are two
     * message factories for SOAP: {@link SaajSoapMessageFactory} and
     * {@link AxiomSoapMessageFactory}. If no message factory is
     * specified (via the messageFactory property), Spring-WS will use the
     * {@link org.springframework.ws.soap.saaj.SaajSoapMessageFactory} by default.
     * <p>
     * The AxiomSoapMessageFactory uses the AXis 2 Object Model to create SoapMessage implementations. AXIOM is based
     * on StAX, the Streaming API for XML. StAX provides a pull-based mechanism for reading XML messages, which can
     * be more efficient for larger messages.
     *
     * @return AxiomSoapMessageFactory {@link AxiomSoapMessageFactory}
     */
  @Bean
    AxiomSoapMessageFactory axiomSoapMessageFactory() {
        AxiomSoapMessageFactory axiomSoapMessageFactory = new AxiomSoapMessageFactory();

        /*
         * To increase reading performance on the AxiomSoapMessageFactory, you can set the payloadCaching property to
         * false (default is true). This will read the contents of the SOAP body directly from the socket stream.
         * When this setting is enabled, the payload can only be read once. This means that you have to make sure
         * that any pre-processing (logging etc.) of the message does not consume it.
         */
        axiomSoapMessageFactory.setPayloadCaching(false);
        //axiomSoapMessageFactory.afterPropertiesSet();

        return axiomSoapMessageFactory;
    }

=== Sending and receiving POJOs - marshalling and un-marshalling

In order to facilitate the sending of plain Java objects, the *WebServiceTemplate* has a number of `send(..)` methods

that take an Object as an argument for a message's data content.

The method `marshalSendAndReceive(..)` in the WebServiceTemplate class delegates the conversion of the request object to XML to a `Marshaller`,

and the conversion of the response XML to an object to an `Unmarshaller`.


To externalize the conversion logic we use `Eclipselink Moxy` Framework.

[source,java]
.marshaller.java
----
/**
     * Handles conversion of JavaObjects to XML vice versa. (uses MOXY to externalize this conversion).
     * <p>
     * In order to facilitate the sending of plain Java objects, the WebServiceTemplate has a number of send(..)

     * conversion of the response XML to an object to an Unmarshaller.
     *
     * @return Jaxb2Marshaller {@link Jaxb2Marshaller}
     */
    public Jaxb2Marshaller jaxb2Marshaller(String path) throws IOException {
        Jaxb2Marshaller jaxb2Marshaller = new Jaxb2Marshaller();
        PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver resolver = new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver();
        Resource[] resources = resolver.getResources("bindings/" + path + "/**");

        Map<String, Object> properties = Collections.singletonMap(JAXBContextProperties.OXM_METADATA_SOURCE, Arrays.stream(resources).map(resource -> "bindings/" + path
                + "/" + resource.getFilename()).collect(Collectors.toList()));

        LOGGER.info("JaxbContextProperties {} ", properties);
        jaxb2Marshaller.setJaxbContextProperties(properties);
        //used to specify java classes to bound. since we are using Moxy we need to provide
        //jaxb.properties file folder - javax.xml.bind.context.factory=org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory
        jaxb2Marshaller.setContextPath("jaxb");//jaxb.context.path
        return jaxb2Marshaller;
    }
